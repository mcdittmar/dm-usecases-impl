# IVOA DataModel Usecase Implementations

## Overview

This repository stores implementations of various usecases for IVOA Data Models.

Data Annotations are produced using the 'Jovial' modeling toolset (Java).  Jovial
  was written by Omar Laurino, and updated by me to the current data model content.
  It provides utilities to help define and create instances of (annotations)
  IVOA VO-DML compliant data models.

Uses the 'rama' python package to parse annotated data file and instantiate
  instances of VO Data Model Classes.  The package also applies Adapters which
  translate certain VO Data Model Classes to corresponding AstroPY types.  
* eg: meas:Point -> astropy:SkyCoord  
* eg: meas:Time  -> astropy:Time  
  This package was developed by Omar Laurino, and updated by me to the current 
  data model content.
